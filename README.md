# nthu_archi_proct1   a single-cycle functional processor simulator
1.This project is for the Computer Architecture in 2016 in NTHU CS 
2.I highly recommend everyone should refer to the project desciption first before begin with the proct or you may not know what my code is
3.Do not plagiarize othersâ€™ work, or you will fail this course.   This is very important that the TA will highly check everyone's code with the one in the previous years.  As a result, you can only refer to my code instead of jsu copying it. Once found plagiarizing the code, TA will email you in person without disturbing others, which is fearsome. However , if you really dont know how to do, you can refer to the one before 2015 . TA may not find it,but i still suggest you not risk
